# heart-disease-prediction-using-ml
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient data (such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical features), the model aims to provide a reliable prediction that can assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning
🚀 Project Overview

Goal: Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes.

Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Models Used: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
